# Password Generator

This is a project that originated from the [Scrimba Front End Developer Career Path](http://scrimba.com) that I have made further enhancements to.

The base project guidelines were:
-Follow a Figma design
-Generate two password based on an array of characters

Since then, I have:
-Refactored the project to React
-Properly implemented stretch goals (User options to enable/disable symbols/numbers + password length)
-Added mobile-first stylings
